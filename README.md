### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ayush Gupta and I come from an oil & gas background. In my early career, I assisted oil & gas offshore projects commissioing of USD 5 billion in India. Working with tonnes of data there while automating and doing regression on Production Data made me passiondate to pursue a full time Master's in Data Science at Duke University. 

Here's what makes me proud for the work I have done in the past 3-4 years:
1. Recognised with Reliance R-Sammman Award for Optimizing Production Systems in the oil & gas industry, for saving USD 500,000 for the company.

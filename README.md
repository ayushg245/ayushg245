### Hi there 👋

My name is Ayush and I am a Data Science graduate student at Duke University. 

In my early career, I assisted oil & gas offshore projects commissioing of USD 5 billion in India. Working with tonnes of data there while automating and doing regression on Production Data made me passiondate to pursue a full time Master's in Data Science. I am an exceptional negotiator and I love to pitch and sell. Moved cross countries because of my curiousity to know and learn from different minds and groups of people. 

Here's what makes me proud for the work I have done in the past 3-4 years:
1. Recognised with Reliance R-Sammman Award for Optimizing Production Systems using Regression Modelling in the oil & gas industry, thereby saving USD 500,000 for the company.
2. Automated the various Production Reports - by using tools like Python and Advanced Excel, saving 80+ hours of Operator's work every month. 
3. Helped my mother to fulfil her dream of being a business-woman by helping her in establishing an export business in Home Beddings : https://www.classycottage.in/

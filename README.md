### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ayush and I am a Data Science graduate student at Duke University. I have a knack of asking a bunch of WHYs until I distill a complicated concept into 3 simple sentences. 

In my early career, I assisted the commissioning of offshore oil & gas projects of USD 5 billion in India. Working with tonnes of production data made me passionate to automate tasks and bring out valuable insights from it. This eventually motivated me to pursue a full time Master's in Data Science. I am an exceptional negotiator and I love to pitch and sell. Moved cross countries because of my curiousity to know and learn from different minds and groups of people. 

Here's what makes me proud for the work I have done in the past 3-4 years:
1. Special Recognition of R-Sammman Award from Reliance Industries Limited for Optimizing Production Systems using Regression Modelling in the oil & gas industry, thereby saving USD 500,000 for the company.
2. Automated the various Production Reports - by using tools like Python and Advanced Excel, saving 80+ hours of Operator's work every month. 
3. Helped my mother to fulfil her dream of being a business-woman by helping her in establishing an export business in Home Beddings : https://www.classycottage.in/
